# rrb-trees-medium-blog

A Clojure project designed to the usage and performance of RRB-Trees and how it complements the native clojure implementation of `Persistent Vectors`.

# Immutable Data Structures - RRB Trees
This repo is meant to accompany the Medium article on [Immutable Data Structures - RRB Trees (Part-1)](https://medium.com/p/177a986950ec/).

The original research paper has been included in the `./resources/` folder in this repository.


# TODO
- Add benchmarks using the `criterium` library for difference in performance.
- Publish a video walk-through on the `One Step Clojure` YouTube channel.
